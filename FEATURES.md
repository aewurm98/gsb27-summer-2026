|---|---|
| `profiles` | id, user_id, email, full_name, photo_url, section (Hometown), additional_details, can_host, hosting_details, open_to_visit, has_completed_profile, is_admin, activity_tags, trip_style, group_size_pref, travel_budget, travel_pace |

| `trek_interests` | id, trek_id, profile_id, status ('interested'/'confirmed'/'declined') |

### Key files
| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/middleware.ts` | Sets `x-pathname` header — prevents infinite redirect for new users with incomplete profiles |
| `src/lib/types.ts` | TypeScript interfaces — source of truth |
| `src/lib/utils.ts` | `getLocationAtWeek` (nomad-aware), `getMatchScore`, `getOverlappingClassmates`, `formatDateRange`, avatar helpers, `getSummerWeeks` |
| `src/components/directory/DirectoryClient.tsx` | Directory grid, Fuse.js search, city/week/tag filters, match scoring |
| `src/components/profile/ProfileEditForm.tsx` | Edit form with location drafts, travel interests, expanded activity tags |
| `src/components/treks/TreksClient.tsx` | Trek list, interest toggling, admin create form, self-serve "I'll lead this" from suggestions |
| `src/components/admin/AdminClient.tsx` | Admin tabs: classmates, profiles, treks, insights (destinations + timeline + heatmap + completeness) |
| `src/components/map/MapClient.tsx` | Mapbox GL JS week-by-week map with resident vs visitor marker distinction |
| `scripts/seed.ts` | Excel → Supabase seed (preserves so_name) |

### Migrations applied
- `001_initial.sql` — base schema
- `002_allow_seeded_profiles.sql` — RLS for seeded profiles
- `003_summer_profile_fields.sql` — hosting/visit fields
- `004_profile_email.sql` — email column + claim trigger
- `005_storage_rls.sql` — avatar storage RLS policies
- `007_travel_preferences_v2.sql` — travel_budget, travel_pace columns
- `008_location_neighborhood.sql` — neighborhood column on locations

---

## Phase 0 — Photo Upload ✅

Avatar storage RLS policies applied. Users can upload/update their own avatar; public read for all.

---

## Phase 1 — Data Enrichment ✅

Activity tags, trip_style, group_size_pref, travel_budget, travel_pace on profiles.  
Intent on travel_interests. activity_tags, cost_tier, max_group_size on treks.

### Activity tag categories (expanded for go-live)
```
Outdoors:           hiking, backpacking, cycling, rock climbing, surfing, water sports, beaches,
                    snow sports, golf, camping
Food & Drink:       fine dining, street food & markets, wine & cocktails, craft beer, cooking classes
Arts & Culture:     museums & galleries, live music & concerts, theater & performance,
                    historical sites, photography
Wellness:           yoga & pilates, running, fitness & gym, spa & wellness
Sports & Rec:       tennis, pickleball, swimming, volleyball & beach sports
Nightlife & Social: bars & nightlife, sports events, rooftop lounges, festivals & events, comedy shows
Travel:             road trips, sailing & boating
```

---

## Phase 2 — Matching Engine + Directory UX ✅

Match score 0–100 across co-location (40 pts), shared travel interests (30 pts),
shared activity tags (20 pts), trip vibe/budget/pace (15 pts).

Harvey-ball match indicator on directory cards; sort by Best Match or A–Z.
Activity tag filter pills in directory (viewer's own tags highlighted).
Match reasons shown on profile pages.

---

## Phase 3 — Trek Enhancements ✅

### Suggested treks
Destinations with 3+ classmates expressing travel interest auto-appear as suggested treks.
Any logged-in classmate can click **"I'll lead this"** to create a trek from a suggestion
(admin sees "Create trek"). The creator is shown as group lead on the trek card.
Admin retains full management capabilities (member picker, top-level "New trek").

### Trek enrichment
Activity tags, cost tier, max group size on trek cards and create form.

---

## Phase 4 — Admin Analytics ✅

### Insights tab sub-views
- **Destinations** — table of top interest destinations with classmate names
  - **Interest timeline** toggle — week-by-week heatmap of interest concentration for each destination
    (uses interest_start_date/interest_end_date; no-date interests count all summer)
- **Weekly heatmap** — classmates per city per week (top 8 cities)
- **Completeness** — per-classmate data completeness score with sort controls

---

## Phase 5 — Nomad Support ✅ (go-live addition)

### Middleware fix
`src/middleware.ts` sets the `x-pathname` request header consumed by the `(main)` layout.
Without it, new users with `has_completed_profile=false` would be stuck in an infinite
redirect loop even when on `/profile/edit`.

### Smart location resolution
`getLocationAtWeek` now collects ALL locations overlapping a given week and returns the
**shortest-duration** (most specific) match. A 3-day Paris visit correctly wins over a
3-month internship for those specific days, properly surfacing nomadic short stays on
the map and in match scoring.

### Map: resident vs visitor markers
- **Red circle** — profiles whose location label is `Summer Internship` or `Other` (based/residing)
- **Sky-blue circle with ✈** — profiles labeled `Traveling` or `Visiting family/friends`
- Mixed cities: red circle with small ✈ badge showing visitor count
- Legend shown at top-left of the map
- City popup distinguishes visitors with a "✈ visiting" pill
